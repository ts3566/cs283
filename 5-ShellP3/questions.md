1. Your shell forks multiple child processes when executing piped commands. How does your implementation ensure that all child processes complete before the shell continues accepting user input? What would happen if you forgot to call waitpid() on all child processes?

_Our shell implementation ensures all child processes complete before accepting new user input by using the waitpid() system call to track and wait for each forked process in the pipeline. After creating pipes and forking child processes in execute_pipeline(), the parent process closes all pipe file descriptors and then systematically waits for each child to terminate using a loop that calls waitpid() on every valid PID. This prevents the shell from returning to the command prompt until all piped commands have finished execution. If waitpid() was not used, zombie processes would accumulate, system resources would leak, and over time these issues could exhaust system resources._

2. The dup2() function is used to redirect input and output file descriptors. Explain why it is necessary to close unused pipe ends after calling dup2(). What could go wrong if you leave pipes open?

_Closing unused pipe ends after calling dup2() is necessary because dup2() only duplicates file descriptors but doesn't close the original ones, leading to descriptor leaks if left unclosed. When a process uses dup2() to redirect stdin/stdout to pipe ends, the original pipe file descriptors remain open and active unless explicitly closed. If these unused pipe ends remain open, programs expecting EOF might hang indefinitely since EOF is only detected when all write ends of a pipe are closed._

3. Your shell recognizes built-in commands (cd, exit, dragon). Unlike external commands, built-in commands do not require execvp(). Why is cd implemented as a built-in rather than an external command? What challenges would arise if cd were implemented as an external process?

_The cd command must be implemented as a built-in rather than an external command because it needs to change the current working directory of the shell process itself. When a shell executes an external command using fork() and execvp(), it creates a child process that runs independently and cannot modify its parent's environment. If cd were implemented as an external process, it would change only the working directory of its own process, but when that process terminated, the shell's working directory would remain unchanged._

4. Currently, your shell supports a fixed number of piped commands (CMD_MAX). How would you modify your implementation to allow an arbitrary number of piped commands while still handling memory allocation efficiently? What trade-offs would you need to consider?

_To modify our shell implementation to support an arbitrary number of piped commands, we would need to replace the fixed-size arrays with dynamically allocated data structures. Instead of using a statically sized command_list_t with a predefined CMD_MAX limit, we could implement a linked list of commands or use a dynamically resizable array. The execute_pipeline() function would need to allocate pipe arrays dynamically based on the number of commands, and similarly, the array of process IDs would need to grow as needed. Some trade-offs would be the increased complexity in memory management, requiring thorough error handling to prevent leaks and the need to respect system limits on open file descriptors, since each pipe consumes two file descriptors._
